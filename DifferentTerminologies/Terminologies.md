1. Resource: A Terraform resource is a component that represents a single, manageable item in your infrastructure, such as a virtual machine, network, or database.
2. Provider: A Terraform provider is a component that implements Terraform's resource types for a specific service or infrastructure, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.
3. Module: A Terraform module is a reusable and organized unit of Terraform code that can be used to manage a specific aspect of infrastructure.
4. Variable: A Terraform variable is a component that allows Terraform code to be parameterized, making it more flexible and reusable.
5. State: The state is a Terraform component that keeps track of the infrastructure that has been created and managed by Terraform. The state is stored in a Terraform state file, which can be stored locally or remotely.
6. Provisioner: A Terraform provisioner is a component that can be used to run scripts or perform other actions on the infrastructure after it has been created.
7. Input Variables: Input variables are Terraform variables that are used to input values into Terraform code. Input variables can be defined in Terraform code or in a separate variables file.
8. Workspaces: Workspaces are Terraform components that can be used to create multiple instances of the same Terraform code with different variables and state. Workspaces are useful for managing multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production.
9. Data Sources: Data sources are Terraform components that allow Terraform to retrieve data from external sources, such as APIs or databases, and use that data in Terraform code.
10. Outputs: Outputs are Terraform components that allow Terraform to return values from Terraform code. Outputs can be used to retrieve information about the infrastructure that has been created, such as IP addresses or hostnames.
11. Dependency: A Terraform dependency is a relationship between two or more Terraform resources, indicating that one resource requires another resource to be created or modified first. Terraform uses this information to ensure that resources are created in the correct order.
12. Backend: A Terraform backend is a component that determines where Terraform state is stored and how it is managed. Terraform supports several backends, including local files, remote object storage, and managed services.
13. Configurations: A Terraform configuration is a set of Terraform files that are used to manage a specific aspect of infrastructure. A Terraform configuration can contain multiple resources, variables, modules, and outputs.
14. State Locking: State locking is a feature of Terraform that ensures that only one Terraform process can make changes to the Terraform state at a time. This helps to prevent conflicting changes from being made to the same resources simultaneously.
15. Graph: The Terraform graph is a visual representation of the Terraform code, showing the relationships between Terraform resources and how they depend on each other. The Terraform graph can be used to understand the relationships between resources and to debug Terraform code.
State Import: State import is a feature of Terraform that allows existing infrastructure to be imported into Terraform state. This allows Terraform to manage infrastructure that was created outside of Terraform, such as manually created resources.
