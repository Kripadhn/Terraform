1. Resource model: This model is used to manage individual resources, such as AWS EC2 instances or Google Cloud Storage Buckets.
2. Data model: This model is used to retrieve data about existing resources, such as the list of subnets in a VPC.
3. Module model: This model is used to group resources and data into reusable components, making it easier to manage and maintain infrastructure.
4. Provider model: This model is used to manage resources and data that are provided by external systems, such as AWS, Google Cloud, and more.
5. State model: This model is used to manage the Terraform state, which tracks the metadata and state of resources.
6. Variable model: This model is used to store and manage variables in Terraform, allowing for more flexible and reusable infrastructure code.
7. Output model: This model is used to define and display outputs from Terraform, such as the IP address of an instance or the URL of a load balancer.
8. Provisioner model: This model is used to run scripts and perform other tasks on a resource after it has been created, such as installing software on an EC2 instance.
9. Backend model: This model is used to store Terraform state in a remote location, such as S3 or Terraform Cloud, instead of locally.
10. Workspace model: This model is used to manage multiple isolated environments within a single Terraform configuration, such as development, staging, and production environments.
11. Operators model: This model is used to automate the management of Terraform modules and infrastructure, using tools like Terraform Enterprise, Ansible, and more.
12. Input Variable Constraints model: This model is used to define constraints on input variables, such as specifying valid values or ranges.
13. Loop Model: This model is used to repeat a set of operations multiple times using the count and for_each arguments.
14. Modules Model: This model is used to organize and reuse Terraform code by grouping resources and variables into reusable units.
15. Data Sources Model: This model is used to retrieve information about existing resources outside of Terraform, such as AWS EC2 instances, RDS databases, and more.
16. Output Model: This model is used to display information about resources created by Terraform, such as the public IP address of an EC2 instance.
